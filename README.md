Credit: Thanks for lax1dude, creater of EaglerCraft, for inspiring me to do this project, thanks to ayumi2000, his smashed code actually helped me a lot, the client is based on webgl-render and mineflayer, the server is based on moderpack's server jar file from 1.12, thanks for Introvert and Etcher for help me.
## Why Is My World Already Explored When I Just Start My Server? ##
Delete Everything In Folder "server" Except the mastercraft-server.jar would reset your server. Further Question? Join [Discord!](https://discord.gg/WD2Dj7HgrB)
## Can I determine my server's seed? ##
If you have an NBTExplorer, You can do that, If you meet any problem, join discord.
## Can you join my server and help me? ##
Of course! (If you don't mind me hacking using an hacked client.) Just go to the discord and message me!
## How do you install plugins? ##
This is an vanila server, not an bukkit... If you would like to install plugins, delete the server folder, create an new one, put the bukkit 1.12 jar in, and then rename it mastercraft-server.jar.
## Can I use Forge Or Fabric for my server?
Sure, if you know some code and you can changed the bungee's source code, that is fine! Remeber to shared the completed work with me to inspire me, however, based on my try, these does not work.
## I have a question.... #
Join Offical Discord and pull an forum in the #forum channel! I am waiting for you!
## Change Motd Please.... ##
...... I honestly don't know, maybe in bungee/config.yml's motd settings?
## Singleplayer? ##
Working On It.... It's harder to make a server and let you join using webgl, than making singleplayer.
## Can I local run? ##
Make sure you have npm installed and java 8 installed, download server folder and client folder, go into the server directory by cd server, then java -jar mastercraft-server.jar, then go to client folder, do npm install, then npm start, then go to localhost:8080 for the server and client!
## Github? ##
In process I guess?
